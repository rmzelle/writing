Preface
~~~~~~~

Citation Style Language (CSL) styles can be roughly divided into two classes.
The first class contains the styles that always generate output in one
particular language. These include most journal, publisher and institute-
specific styles, such as the British Psychological Society style, which uses
British English. The second class consists of popular styles that find use in
many languages, such as the American Psychological Association (APA) style.

CSL styles of both classes rely on locale files to provide default localization
data, which consists of translations of words commonly used in citations and
bibliographies, as well as localized date formats and grammatical preferences.
Storing localization data in separate files has several benefits: styles are
more compact (although styles can still provide their own localization data to
override the defaults), and styles themselves can be (mostly) language-agnostic.

This document describes how you can help us to improve CSL's language support by
providing us with accurate localization data for your language of choice.
